# Foundations

## Agency

An entity's capacity to sense and independently process information to achieve its goals.

## Evolution

Entities adapt, change, and develop over time within a simulated environment.

## Autonomy

Self-governing behavior of agents and their ability to operate independently.

## Cause and Effect

Interactions and relationships between events, where one event (the cause) directly influences or brings about another event (the effect).

## Nature and Reality

Fundamental principles, phenomena, and dynamics of the natural world and the fabric of reality within a simulated environment.

## Agent vs Arena

Interactions between agents and their surrounding environment, focusing on how agents perceive, respond to, and adapt within the constraints and opportunities presented by the arena.

## Mind

Cognitive processes, decision-making, and consciousness in agents, focusing on how they perceive, interpret, and interact with their environment.

## Neural Networks

Simulate learning, pattern recognition, and decision-making processes in agents, mimicking the functioning of biological brains. Additionally, they provide a genetic-like substrate for agents to inherit and recombine neural structures with other networks.

## Complexity

Emergent behaviors and interactions arising from the interplay of simple rules and components, leading to sophisticated patterns, self-organization, and adaptive systems.
