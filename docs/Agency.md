Agency is like a ship at sea. Though it is subject to the whims of the waves and wind, a knowledgeable crew can navigate toward their goals, leveraging the very forces that encumber them.

In this way, agency represents an active effort pushing back against the universe, asserting the crew's intent amidst the vast, indifferent ocean.

## Define

Agency refers to the capacity of entities to sense and process information, enabling them to act independently in accordance with core imperatives. This capacity is not an absolute but exists on a continuum, influenced strongly by the external environment in which these entities operate.

All life forms exhibit some degree of agency, allowing them to adaptively respond to their surroundings. This adaptive capability is what differentiates life from inanimate matter. Living agents continuously acquire, store, and process information, which informs their actions and responses throughout their existence.

At one end of the spectrum of agency are entities with low agency, such as bacteria and plants. These organisms display simple reactive behaviors with minimal information processing. Their responses to environmental stimuli are often straightforward and immediate, driven by basic survival needs without complex decision-making.

At the other end of the spectrum are entities with high agency, including mammals and reptiles. These organisms engage in complex decision-making processes, involving significant information processing and often demonstrating foresight. They can evaluate multiple variables and potential outcomes before acting, reflecting a higher level of cognitive function and behavioral sophistication.

In essence, agency encapsulates the varying degrees of autonomy and complexity in the behaviors of living entities, shaped by their capacity to process information and their environmental context.

## Model

Components of agency can be broken down into four key elements: sensing, processing, acting, and autonomy. Each of these components plays a crucial role in determining the degree of agency an entity possesses.

1. **Sensing**: This is the ability of an entity to gather information from its environment. Sensing involves detecting changes and stimuli that can affect the entity's state or surroundings. This information is the foundation upon which all subsequent processes depend.

2. **Processing**: Once information is gathered through sensing, it needs to be interpreted. Processing involves analyzing the information, making decisions based on it, and determining the best course of action. The complexity and efficiency of this processing can vary greatly among different entities, contributing to the spectrum of agency.

3. **Acting**: This component refers to the execution of actions that influence the environment. After processing the information and making decisions, an entity must act to achieve its goals. The effectiveness of these actions depends on the entity's ability to accurately assess situations and respond appropriately.

4. **Autonomy**: Autonomy represents the degree of independence an entity has in its decision-making and actions. High autonomy means that the entity can operate with minimal external influence or control, relying on its own sensing, processing, and acting capabilities to navigate its environment and achieve its objectives.

The environment in which an agent exists can be conceptualized as an arena, illustrating the dynamic agent-arena relationship.

The Arena is the context in which agents operate, interact, and adapt, serving as the stage for their experiences and the backdrop for their decision-making and behaviors. It shapes the challenges they face and the opportunities they encounter, influencing their evolution and development. Keep in mind that the arena also changes as the relationship between it and the agent progresses.

## Measure

Quantifying agency involves evaluating several factors that determine the capacity and effectiveness of an entity's autonomous action. Key aspects include decision complexity, information processing capacity, and autonomy level.

1. **Decision Complexity**: This refers to the sophistication of decisions an entity can make. It can be quantified by the number of variables or dimensions considered in decision-making processes. Entities with higher decision complexity can evaluate multiple factors and scenarios, leading to more nuanced and informed actions.

2. **Information Processing Capacity**: This measures how much information an entity can process within a given time frame. In computational systems, this capacity is often quantified in bits per second. Higher processing capacity allows an entity to handle larger amounts of data, perform more complex analyses, and make quicker decisions.

3. **Autonomy Level**: The degree of independence from external inputs in the decision-making process. This can be quantified by examining the ratio of internally generated actions versus externally triggered responses. A higher autonomy level indicates that the entity relies more on its own sensing and processing capabilities to act, rather than reacting solely to external stimuli.

## Observe

Signs of agency are indicators that reveal the capacity of an entity to act independently and purposefully. These signs include autonomy, intentionality, adaptability, responsiveness, self-regulation, learning and memory, problem-solving, communication, perception, and persistence.

1. **Autonomy**: The ability to make independent decisions and take actions without external control. This signifies a high degree of self-governance and freedom from outside influences.

2. **Intentionality**: Purposeful and goal-directed behavior that indicates the presence of objectives or desires. Entities with intentionality act with specific outcomes in mind.

3. **Adaptability**: The capacity to adjust behaviors and strategies in response to changing environments or circumstances. Adaptable entities can modify their actions to better suit new conditions.

4. **Responsiveness**: The ability to react to stimuli or changes in the environment in a meaningful way. Responsiveness demonstrates an entity's capacity to sense and appropriately respond to external factors.

5. **Self-regulation**: Managing and controlling one's own actions and internal states to achieve desired outcomes. Self-regulation involves maintaining focus and direction despite potential internal or external disruptions.

6. **Learning and Memory**: The ability to acquire new knowledge or skills from experience and retain that information for future use. This capability allows entities to improve their performance over time and apply past experiences to new situations.

7. **Problem-solving**: Identifying challenges and devising effective strategies to overcome them. Problem-solving showcases an entity's capacity to understand complex situations and find solutions.

8. **Communication**: The exchange of information with other agents or the environment. Effective communication indicates a level of understanding and interaction necessary for coordinating actions and achieving goals.

9. **Perception**: Sensing and interpreting the surrounding environment to inform decisions and actions. Perception provides the necessary information for an entity to navigate and respond to its surroundings.

10. **Persistence**: Continuing efforts towards goals despite obstacles or difficulties. Persistence demonstrates determination and the ability to maintain effort in the face of challenges.

## Analyze
Analyzing agency involves evaluating how entities behave and perform under various conditions, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. This can be achieved through scenario-based analysis, the use of quantitative metrics, and qualitative analysis.

### Scenario-Based Analysis

1. **Design Different Scenarios**: Create varied conditions to test agent behavior, such as:
   - **Resource Scarcity**: Assess how an agent manages limited resources.
   - **Competition**: Evaluate how an agent competes with others for resources or goals.
   - **Cooperation**: Observe how an agent collaborates with others to achieve mutual goals.

2. **Measure Performance**: Track how well the agent achieves its goals under each scenario. Performance metrics can include efficiency, success rate, and resource management.

### Quantitative Metrics

1. **Response Time**: Measure the speed at which an agent can sense, process information, and take action. This is crucial for evaluating the agent's efficiency and responsiveness.

2. **Success Rate**: Calculate the percentage of goals achieved over a set period. A higher success rate indicates more effective agency.

3. **Adaptability Index**: Assess how well an agent adjusts its behavior in response to environmental changes. This can involve tracking behavioral modifications and their effectiveness in new conditions.

### Qualitative Analysis

1. **Decision-Making Patterns and Strategies**: Observe how an agent makes decisions. This includes:
   - The complexity of decisions.
   - The variety of strategies employed.
   - Consistency in decision-making processes.

2. **Interactions Between Agents and Environment**: Analyze how agents interact with their environment and other agents. This includes:
   - Communication and information exchange.
   - Cooperative versus competitive behaviors.
   - The impact of these interactions on achieving goals.
