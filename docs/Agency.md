# Agency

> "The ingredients of agency are information and computation." - Judea Pearl

Agency is like a ship at sea. Though it is subject to the whims of the waves and wind, a knowledgeable crew can navigate toward their goals, leveraging the very forces that encumber them.

In this way, agency represents an active effort pushing back against the universe, asserting the crew's intent amidst the vast, indifferent ocean.

### Foundation goals

- Define agency in a general structure
- Model that definition within a complex and dynamic simulation
- Measure agency by the volume and complexity of information an agent can process.
- Observe and analyze agent behavior across various situations.

## Define

Agency is the capacity of entities to sense, process information, and act independently to achieve their goals, influenced by their external environment.

This capacity exists on a continuum rather than as a binary switch. All life forms possess some degree of agency, enabling them to respond adaptively to their surroundings.

It is this ability to acquire, store, and process information that distinguishes life from inanimate matter, with agents continuously processing as long as they exist.

- **Low Agency:** Simple reactive behaviors with minimal processing.
- **High Agency:** Complex decision-making with significant information processing and foresight.

## Model

Modeling agency is the core function of the project, offering limitless approaches and perspectives to experiment with.

### Components of agency

1. **Sensing:** The ability to gather information from the environment.
2. **Processing:** The ability to interpret and make decisions based on the information.
3. **Acting:** The ability to execute actions that influence the environment to achieve goals.
4. **Autonomy:** The degree of independence in decision-making and action.

### The Arena

The environment in which an agent exists can be conceptualized as an arena, illustrating the dynamic agent-arena relationship.

The Arena is the context in which agents operate, interact, and adapt, serving as the stage for their experiences and the backdrop for their decision-making and behaviors. It shapes the challenges they face and the opportunities they encounter, influencing their evolution and development.

## Measure

### Quantifying agency

- **Decision Complexity**: The complexity of decisions the entity can make, perhaps quantified by the number of variables or dimensions considered in decision-making processes.
- **Information Processing Capacity**: How much information the entity can process within a given time frame, which could be measured in bits for computational systems.
- **Autonomy Level**: The degree of independence the entity has from external inputs in its decision-making process, potentially quantifiable by examining the ratio of internally generated actions versus externally triggered responses.

Defining agency in this manner provides a concrete, observable framework that applies across both biological organisms and artificial systems, allowing for empirical study and comparison. It shifts the focus from abstract philosophical considerations to tangible, measurable attributes and behaviors, facilitating a more scientific exploration of agency in the physical and informational dimensions.

## Observe

### Signs of agency

1. **Autonomy**: The ability to make independent decisions and take actions without external control.
2. **Intentionality**: Purposeful and goal-directed behavior indicating the presence of objectives or desires.
3. **Adaptability**: The capacity to adjust behaviors and strategies in response to changing environments or circumstances.
4. **Responsiveness**: Reacting to stimuli or changes in the environment in a meaningful way.
5. **Self-regulation**: Managing and controlling one's own actions and internal states to achieve desired outcomes.
6. **Learning and Memory**: The ability to acquire new knowledge or skills from experience and retain that information for future use.
7. **Problem-solving**: Identifying challenges and devising effective strategies to overcome them.
8. **Communication**: The exchange of information with other agents or the environment, indicating a level of understanding and interaction.
9. **Perception**: Sensing and interpreting the surrounding environment to inform decisions and actions.
10. **Persistence**: Continuing efforts towards goals despite obstacles or difficulties.

### Analysis

1. **Scenario-Based Analysis:**
    - Design different scenarios to test agent behavior under various conditions (e.g., resource scarcity, competition, cooperation).
    - Measure the agent's performance in achieving its goals.
2. **Quantitative Metrics:**
    - **Response Time:** How quickly an agent can sense, process, and act.
    - **Success Rate:** The percentage of goals achieved over a set period.
    - **Adaptability Index:** A measure of how well an agent adjusts its behavior in response to environmental changes.
3. **Qualitative Analysis:**
    - Observe decision-making patterns and strategies.
    - Analyze interactions between agents and the environment.
