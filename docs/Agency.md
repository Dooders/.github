# Agency

> "The ingredients of agency are information and computation." - Judea Pearl

Agency is like a ship at sea. Though it is subject to the whims of the waves and wind, a knowledgeable crew can navigate toward their goals, leveraging the very forces that encumber them.

In this way, agency represents an active effort pushing back against the universe, asserting the crew's intent amidst the vast, indifferent ocean.

### Foundation goals

- Define agency in a general structure
- Model that definition within a complex and dynamic simulation
- Measure agency by the volume and complexity of information an agent can process.
- Observe and analyze agent behavior across various situations.

## Define

Agency refers to the capacity of entities to sense and process information, enabling them to act independently in accordance with core imperatives. This capacity is not an absolute but exists on a continuum, influenced strongly by the external environment in which these entities operate.

All life forms exhibit some degree of agency, allowing them to adaptively respond to their surroundings. This adaptive capability is what differentiates life from inanimate matter. Living agents continuously acquire, store, and process information, which informs their actions and responses throughout their existence.

At one end of the spectrum of agency are entities with low agency, such as bacteria and plants. These organisms display simple reactive behaviors with minimal information processing. Their responses to environmental stimuli are often straightforward and immediate, driven by basic survival needs without complex decision-making.

At the other end of the spectrum are entities with high agency, including mammals and reptiles. These organisms engage in complex decision-making processes, involving significant information processing and often demonstrating foresight. They can evaluate multiple variables and potential outcomes before acting, reflecting a higher level of cognitive function and behavioral sophistication.

In essence, agency encapsulates the varying degrees of autonomy and complexity in the behaviors of living entities, shaped by their capacity to process information and their environmental context.

## Model

Components of agency can be broken down into four key elements: sensing, processing, acting, and autonomy. Each of these components plays a crucial role in determining the degree of agency an entity possesses.

1. **Sensing**: This is the ability of an entity to gather information from its environment. Sensing involves detecting changes and stimuli that can affect the entity's state or surroundings. This information is the foundation upon which all subsequent processes depend.

2. **Processing**: Once information is gathered through sensing, it needs to be interpreted. Processing involves analyzing the information, making decisions based on it, and determining the best course of action. The complexity and efficiency of this processing can vary greatly among different entities, contributing to the spectrum of agency.

3. **Acting**: This component refers to the execution of actions that influence the environment. After processing the information and making decisions, an entity must act to achieve its goals. The effectiveness of these actions depends on the entity's ability to accurately assess situations and respond appropriately.

4. **Autonomy**: Autonomy represents the degree of independence an entity has in its decision-making and actions. High autonomy means that the entity can operate with minimal external influence or control, relying on its own sensing, processing, and acting capabilities to navigate its environment and achieve its objectives.

### The Arena

The environment in which an agent exists can be conceptualized as an arena, illustrating the dynamic agent-arena relationship.

The Arena is the context in which agents operate, interact, and adapt, serving as the stage for their experiences and the backdrop for their decision-making and behaviors. It shapes the challenges they face and the opportunities they encounter, influencing their evolution and development. Keep in mind that the arena also changes as the relationship between it and the agent progresses.

## Measure

### Quantifying agency

- **Decision Complexity**: The complexity of decisions the entity can make, perhaps quantified by the number of variables or dimensions considered in decision-making processes.
- **Information Processing Capacity**: How much information the entity can process within a given time frame, which could be measured in bits for computational systems.
- **Autonomy Level**: The degree of independence the entity has from external inputs in its decision-making process, potentially quantifiable by examining the ratio of internally generated actions versus externally triggered responses.

Defining agency in this manner provides a concrete, observable framework that applies across both biological organisms and artificial systems, allowing for empirical study and comparison. It shifts the focus from abstract philosophical considerations to tangible, measurable attributes and behaviors, facilitating a more scientific exploration of agency in the physical and digital dimensions.

## Observe

### Signs of agency

1. **Autonomy**: The ability to make independent decisions and take actions without external control.
2. **Intentionality**: Purposeful and goal-directed behavior indicating the presence of objectives or desires.
3. **Adaptability**: The capacity to adjust behaviors and strategies in response to changing environments or circumstances.
4. **Responsiveness**: Reacting to stimuli or changes in the environment in a meaningful way.
5. **Self-regulation**: Managing and controlling one's own actions and internal states to achieve desired outcomes.
6. **Learning and Memory**: The ability to acquire new knowledge or skills from experience and retain that information for future use.
7. **Problem-solving**: Identifying challenges and devising effective strategies to overcome them.
8. **Communication**: The exchange of information with other agents or the environment, indicating a level of understanding and interaction.
9. **Perception**: Sensing and interpreting the surrounding environment to inform decisions and actions.
10. **Persistence**: Continuing efforts towards goals despite obstacles or difficulties.

### Analysis

1. **Scenario-Based Analysis:**
    - Design different scenarios to test agent behavior under various conditions (e.g., resource scarcity, competition, cooperation).
    - Measure the agent's performance in achieving its goals.
2. **Quantitative Metrics:**
    - **Response Time:** How quickly an agent can sense, process, and act.
    - **Success Rate:** The percentage of goals achieved over a set period.
    - **Adaptability Index:** A measure of how well an agent adjusts its behavior in response to environmental changes.
3. **Qualitative Analysis:**
    - Observe decision-making patterns and strategies.
    - Analyze interactions between agents and the environment.
