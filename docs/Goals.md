## Philosophical Goals of the Dooders Project

1. **Investigate the Nature of Consciousness**: To explore and understand the essence of consciousness and self-awareness in both artificial and biological agents. This involves examining what it means to be conscious and how consciousness might arise in a simulated environment.

2. **Examine Free Will and Autonomy**: To delve into the concepts of free will and autonomy, questioning the extent to which agents can be said to act independently and make free choices within a deterministic or stochastic simulation framework.

3. **Explore the Concept of Agency**: To define and analyze the notion of agency, including the conditions that give rise to it and how it manifests in different forms of life, both natural and artificial. This involves philosophical inquiries into what constitutes an agent and its moral and ethical implications.

4. **Understand Emergence and Complexity**: To philosophically investigate how complex behaviors and systems emerge from simple rules and interactions. This includes exploring the principles of self-organization, adaptation, and the nature of complexity.

5. **Reflect on Human Identity and Existence**: To use the simulation as a tool for reflecting on human identity, existence, and our place in the universe. This goal seeks to draw parallels between simulated agents and human beings, offering insights into our own nature and the fabric of reality.

6. **Challenge Traditional Boundaries**: To question and challenge traditional boundaries between the artificial and the natural, the simulated and the real. This involves exploring how these distinctions blur and what implications this has for our understanding of reality.

7. **Investigate Ethical and Moral Questions**: To address ethical and moral questions related to the creation and treatment of artificial agents. This includes considerations of the rights of artificial entities, the responsibilities of their creators, and the ethical dimensions of simulating life.
