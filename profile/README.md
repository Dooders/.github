Dooders is not only a technical endeavor but also a philosophical and artistic exploration. It delves into questions about the nature of intelligence, existence, and interaction. The project's philosophical dimension investigates the essence of agency, autonomy, and consciousness, while its artistic aspect seeks to visualize and express the beauty of emergent behaviors and complex systems.

By blending philosophy, art, and technology, Dooders aims to create a rich, multi-layered system that challenges and expands the understanding of intelligence and agency.

# Foundations

- **Agency**: An entity's capacity to sense and independently process information to achieve its goals.
- **Evolution**: Entities adapt, change, and develop over time within a simulated environment.
- **Autonomy:** Self-governing behavior of agents and their ability to operate independently.
- **Cause and Effect**: Interactions and relationships between events, where one event (the cause) directly influences or brings about another event (the effect).
- **Nature and Reality**: Fundamental principles, phenomena, and dynamics of the natural world and the fabric of reality within a simulated environment.
- **Agent vs Arena**: Interactions between agents and their surrounding environment, focusing on how agents perceive, respond to, and adapt within the constraints and opportunities presented by the arena.
- **Mind**: Cognitive processes, decision-making, and consciousness in agents, focusing on how they perceive, interpret, and interact with their environment.
- **Neural Networks**: Simulate learning, pattern recognition, and decision-making processes in agents, mimicking the functioning of biological brains. Additionally, they provide a genetic-like substrate for agents to inherit and recombine neural structures with other networks.
- **Complexity**: Emergent behaviors and interactions arising from the interplay of simple rules and components, leading to sophisticated patterns, self-organization, and adaptive systems.


# Projects

## [Dooders](https://github.com/Dooders/Dooders)
### An open-source agent model. 
*In-Development* 
- This project serves as the primary repository for research, development, and results related to the creation and evolution of these agents. 
- By simulating complex environments and interactions, Dooders aims to advance the understanding of how intelligence can develop and thrive in artificial settings.


## [TimeBandit](https://github.com/Dooders/TimeBandit)
### An object-oriented simulation framework designed to facilitate the creation, execution, and analysis of temporal simulations. 
*In-Development* 
- With robust time travel mechanisms, TimeBandit ensures a consistent and flexible environment for exploring complex, time-dependent scenarios.


## [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph)

### A lightweight and decentralized graph system designed for agent-centric modeling. 
*In-Development* 
- Each node in AnarchyGraph is responsible for its own data, state, and behavior, enabling a flexible and autonomous simulation environment. 
- Ideal for projects requiring distributed agent-based simulations, AnarchyGraph empowers nodes to independently manage their interactions and evolutions within the graph.


## [Fizicks](https://github.com/Dooders/Fizicks)
### A state-driven physics model designed to simulate cause and effect within a physical space. 
*In-Development* 
- This foundational deterministic system provides the underlying laws governing interactions and behaviors in the simulation. 
- While maintaining a degree of simplicity, Fizicks establishes a framework for modeling physical phenomena, making it ideal for creating realistic and consistent environments for various simulations.

## [TemporalObject](https://github.com/Dooders/TemporalObject) 
 ### A custom object designed to encapsulate an agent, providing a comprehensive state management system with full state history and traversal capabilities. 
 *In-Development* 
 - This container allows for the precise tracking of state changes over time, enabling detailed version control and temporal analysis. 
 - Ideal for applications requiring historical data tracking and state buffering, TemporalObject ensures robust and flexible state management for complex simulations.
