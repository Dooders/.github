# Overview

Welcome to Dooders, an open-source initiative focused on researching the emergence of intelligent agents within simulated realities. Its mission is to advance the understanding of agency through continuous exploration and experimentation, demonstrating the potential value of agent-based systems learning.

## Current Priorities

- Modeling the Agent and Arena relationship with [Dooders](https://github.com/Dooders/Dooders):
- Physics inspired deterministic universes with [Fizicks](https://github.com/Dooders/Fizicks):
- A Temporal simulation engine with [TimeBandit](https://github.com/Dooders/TimeBandit):
- Evolutionary algorithms with [ContinuousEvolution](https://github.com/Dooders/ContinuousEvolution):
- Autonomous and independent agents with [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph):


The project is structured around three core aspects: Technical, Philosophical, and Artistic. The technical aspect focuses on leveraging open-source principles, state-of-the-art algorithms, and high-performance architectures.

The philosophical aspect delves into the essence of agency, autonomy, and consciousness, exploring fundamental questions about what it means to be an intelligent agent. Finally, the artistic aspect aims to visualize and express the beauty of emergent behaviors and complex systems, capturing the intricate interplay of these elements in a visually engaging manner.

By blending philosophy, art, and technology, Dooders aspires to create a rich, multi-layered, and multi-discipline endeavor that challenges and expands our understanding of intelligence and agency.

## Other Projects

### [TemporalObject](https://github.com/Dooders/TemporalObject) ![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-orange)
#### A custom object designed to encapsulate an agent, providing a comprehensive state management system with full state history and traversal capabilities

- This container allows for the precise tracking of state changes over time, enabling detailed version control and temporal analysis.
- Ideal for applications requiring historical data tracking and state buffering, TemporalObject ensures robust and flexible state management for complex simulations.
