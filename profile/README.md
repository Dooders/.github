# Overview

Welcome to Dooders, an open-source project researching the emergence of intelligent agents within simulated realities. Its mission is to advance the understanding of agency through continuous exploration and experimentation, demonstrating the potential value of agent-based systems learning.

## Primary Research
* [Agent-Arena Co-Evolutionary Model](https://rememberization.substack.com/p/out-with-training-in-with-emergence)
  * [Investigating Convergence of Neural Network Models to Similar Solutions](https://github.com/Dooders/Experiments/blob/main/Investigating%20Convergence%20of%20Neural%20Network%20Models%20to%20Similar%20Solutions.md)

## Other Priorities

- Modeling a biological cell with [Pyology](https://github.com/Dooders/Pyology).
- Exploring the Agent and Arena relationship with [Dooders](https://github.com/Dooders/Dooders).
- Physics inspired universes with [Fizicks](https://github.com/Dooders/Fizicks).
- A Temporal simulation engine with [TimeBandit](https://github.com/Dooders/TimeBandit).
- Evolutionary algorithms with [ContinuousEvolution](https://github.com/Dooders/ContinuousEvolution).
- Autonomous and independent agents with [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph).

## Core Perspectives
The project is structured around three core aspects: Technical, Philosophical, and Artistic. The technical aspect focuses on leveraging open-source principles, state-of-the-art algorithms, and high-performance architectures.

The philosophical aspect delves into the essence of agency, autonomy, and consciousness, exploring fundamental questions about what it means to be an intelligent agent. Finally, the artistic aspect aims to visualize and express the beauty of emergent behaviors and complex systems, capturing the intricate interplay of these elements in a visually engaging manner.

By blending philosophy, art, and technology, Dooders aspires to create a rich, multi-layered, and multi-discipline endeavor that challenges and expands our understanding of intelligence and agency.
