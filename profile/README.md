Welcome to Dooders, an open-source initiative dedicated to researching the emergence of intelligent agents within simulated realities. It's mission is to advance the understanding of agency through comprehensive exploration and experimentation.

# Focus

- **Decision-Making Processes:** Analyzing how agents make choices within simulated environments.
- **Autonomy:** Investigating the self-governing behavior of agents and their ability to operate independently.
- **Interactions:** Studying the dynamics between agents and their environments, as well as agent-to-agent interactions.

# Projects

## [Dooders](https://github.com/Dooders/Dooders)
### An open-source project dedicated to exploring the emergence of intelligent agents within a simulated reality. 
*In-Development* 
- This project serves as the primary repository for research, development, and results related to the creation and evolution of these agents. 
- By simulating complex environments and interactions, Dooders aims to advance our understanding of how intelligence can develop and thrive in artificial settings.


## [TimeBandit](https://github.com/Dooders/TimeBandit)
### An object-oriented simulation framework designed to facilitate the creation, execution, and analysis of temporal simulations. 
*In-Development* 
- With robust time travel mechanisms, TimeBandit ensures a consistent and flexible environment for exploring complex, time-dependent scenarios.


## [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph)

### A lightweight and decentralized graph system designed for agent-centric modeling. 
*In-Development* 
- Each node in AnarchyGraph is responsible for its own data, state, and behavior, enabling a flexible and autonomous simulation environment. 
- Ideal for projects requiring distributed agent-based simulations, AnarchyGraph empowers nodes to independently manage their interactions and evolutions within the graph.


## [Fizicks](https://github.com/Dooders/Fizicks)
### A state-driven physics model designed to simulate cause and effect within a physical space. 
*In-Development* 
- This foundational deterministic system provides the underlying laws governing interactions and behaviors in the simulation. 
- While maintaining a degree of simplicity, Fizicks establishes a framework for modeling physical phenomena, making it ideal for creating realistic and consistent environments for various simulations.

## [TemporalObject](https://github.com/Dooders/TemporalObject) 
 ### A custom object designed to encapsulate an agent, providing a comprehensive state management system with full state history and traversal capabilities. 
 *In-Development* 
 - This container allows for the precise tracking of state changes over time, enabling detailed version control and temporal analysis. 
 - Ideal for applications requiring historical data tracking and state buffering, TemporalObject ensures robust and flexible state management for complex simulations.
