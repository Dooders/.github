# Overview

Welcome to Dooders, an open-source initiative dedicated to researching the emergence of intelligent agents within simulated realities. Its mission is to advance the understanding of agency through comprehensive and ongoing exploration and experimentation.

The project is structured around three core aspects: Technical, Philosophical, and Artistic.

The Technical aspect focuses on leveraging open-source principles, state-of-the-art algorithms, and high-performance architectures. 

The Philosophical aspect delves into the essence of agency, autonomy, and consciousness, exploring fundamental questions about what it means to be an intelligent agent. 

Finally, the Artistic aspect aims to visualize and express the beauty of emergent behaviors and complex systems, capturing the intricate interplay of these elements in a visually engaging manner.

By blending philosophy, art, and technology, Dooders aspires to create a rich, multi-layered, and multi-discipline system that challenges and expands our understanding of intelligence and agency.

#### An object-oriented simulation framework designed to facilitate the creation, execution, and analysis of temporal simulations

- With robust time travel mechanisms, TimeBandit ensures a consistent and flexible environment for exploring complex, time-dependent scenarios.

### [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph)
![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-orange)
#### A lightweight and decentralized graph system designed for agent-centric modeling

- Each node in AnarchyGraph is responsible for its own data, state, and behavior, enabling a flexible and autonomous simulation environment.
- Ideal for projects requiring distributed agent-based simulations, AnarchyGraph empowers nodes to independently manage their interactions and evolutions within the graph.

### [Fizicks](https://github.com/Dooders/Fizicks)
![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-orange)
#### A state-driven physics model designed to simulate cause and effect within a physical space

- This foundational deterministic system provides the underlying laws governing interactions and behaviors in the simulation. 
- While maintaining a degree of simplicity, Fizicks establishes a framework for modeling physical phenomena, making it ideal for creating realistic and consistent environments for various simulations.

### [TemporalObject](https://github.com/Dooders/TemporalObject)
![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-orange)
#### A custom object designed to encapsulate an agent, providing a comprehensive state management system with full state history and traversal capabilities

- This container allows for the precise tracking of state changes over time, enabling detailed version control and temporal analysis.
- Ideal for applications requiring historical data tracking and state buffering, TemporalObject ensures robust and flexible state management for complex simulations.
