Welcome to Dooders, an open-source initiative dedicated to researching the emergence of intelligent agents within simulated realities. It's mission is to advance the understanding of agency through comprehensive exploration and experimentation.

# Focus

- **Decision-Making Processes:** Analyzing how agents make choices within simulated environments.
- **Autonomy:** Investigating the self-governing behavior of agents and their ability to operate independently.
- **Interactions:** Studying the dynamics between agents and their environments, as well as agent-to-agent interactions.
