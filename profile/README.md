# Overview

Welcome to Dooders, an open-source initiative focused on researching the emergence of intelligent agents within simulated realities. Its mission is to advance the understanding of agency through continuous exploration and experimentation, demonstrating the potential value of agent-based systems learning.

# Current Priorities

- Model the Agent and Arena relationship with [Dooders](https://github.com/Dooders/Dooders):
  - Breaking down agency into key components such as autonomy, adaptability, problem-solving, social interaction, and self-regulation.
- Simulation Engine with [TimeBandit](https://github.com/Dooders/TimeBandit):
  - Developing a library to create and inspect simulations where agents face diverse challenges and opportunities, including resource management, environmental changes, and social interactions.
- Evolutionary Algorithms with [ContinuousEvolution](https://github.com/Dooders/ContinuousEvolution):
  - Experimenting with evolutionary algorithms to drive agent selection. Agents with higher agency—demonstrated through better adaptation, problem-solving, and interaction—will be selected over those with lower agency.
- Autonamous and independent agents with [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph).
  - Utilizing a decentralized, node-centric graph system, where each node possesses all the necessary resources to independently fulfill its purpose or perform its tasks.
- Continuous Optimization:
  - Measuring and optimizing agents' agency, driving them to discover and exploit new niches in the environment, enhancing their intelligence, adaptability, and overall effectiveness.

The project is structured around three core aspects: Technical, Philosophical, and Artistic.

The Technical aspect focuses on leveraging open-source principles, state-of-the-art algorithms, and high-performance architectures.

The Philosophical aspect delves into the essence of agency, autonomy, and consciousness, exploring fundamental questions about what it means to be an intelligent agent.

Finally, the Artistic aspect aims to visualize and express the beauty of emergent behaviors and complex systems, capturing the intricate interplay of these elements in a visually engaging manner.

By blending philosophy, art, and technology, Dooders aspires to create a rich, multi-layered, and multi-discipline system that challenges and expands our understanding of intelligence and agency.
