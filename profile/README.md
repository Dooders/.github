# Overview

Welcome to Dooders, an open-source project researching the emergence of intelligent agents within a computational model of reality. Its mission is to advance the understanding of agency through continuous exploration and experimentation, demonstrating the potential value of agent-based systems learning.

## Primary Research
* [Agent-Arena Co-Evolutionary Model](https://rememberization.substack.com/p/out-with-training-in-with-emergence)
  * [Investigating Convergence of Neural Network Models to Similar Solutions](https://github.com/Dooders/Experiments/tree/main/SolutionSpace)

## Other Priorities

- Modeling a biological cell with [Pyology](https://github.com/Dooders/Pyology).
- Exploring the Agent and Arena relationship with [Dooders](https://github.com/Dooders/Dooders).
- Physics inspired universes with [Fizicks](https://github.com/Dooders/Fizicks).
- A Temporal simulation engine with [TimeBandit](https://github.com/Dooders/TimeBandit).
- Evolutionary algorithms with [ContinuousEvolution](https://github.com/Dooders/ContinuousEvolution).
- Autonomous and independent agents with [AnarchyGraph](https://github.com/Dooders/AnarchyGraph).
