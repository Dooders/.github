# Overview

Welcome to Dooders, an open-source project researching the emergence of intelligent agents within a computational model of reality. Its mission is to advance the understanding of agency through continuous exploration and experimentation, demonstrating the potential value of agent-based systems learning.

  *All research and development is in the early stages.*

* [Agent-Arena Co-Evolutionary Model](https://rememberization.substack.com/p/out-with-training-in-with-emergence)
  * [AgentMeaning](https://github.com/Dooders/AgentMeaning)
    * [Adversarial Meaning Robustness](/proposals/adversarial_meaning_robustness_proposal.md)*
    * [Attention Mechanisms in Meaning Preservation](/proposals/attention_mechanisms_proposal.md)*
    * [Agent Memory Sharing](/proposals/agent_memory_sharing_proposal.md)*
    * [Counterfactual Meaning Testing](/proposals/counterfactual_meaning_testing_proposal.md)*
    * [Explainable Meaning Transformation](/proposals/explainable_meaning_transformation_proposal.md)*
    * [Hierarchical Meaning Representation](/proposals/hierarchical_meaning_proposal.md)*
    * [Multi-Modal Semantic Compression](/proposals/multi_modal_semantic_compression_proposal.md)*
