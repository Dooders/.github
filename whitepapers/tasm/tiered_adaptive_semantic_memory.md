# Tiered Adaptive Semantic Memory (TASM): Compressing Experience through Embeddings  
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development%20–%20Experimental%20%26%20Aspirational-blue)

## Overview

TASM creates a memory system for intelligent agents that captures the semantic essence of experiences while providing bidirectional translation between detailed states and compressed representations. By combining transformation pipelines with autoencoder networks, agents can efficiently store, retrieve, and reconstruct experiences based on their meaningful content rather than arbitrary storage patterns.

> _Note: TASM's design is subject to key open challenges, including the fidelity–compression tradeoff, catastrophic forgetting, and high training requirements (see [Challenges](#challenges-and-considerations))._

## Core Components

### 1. State Representation
The full agent experience at any given time includes:
- Environmental state (position, objects, terrain)
- Agent internal state (health, resources, goals)
- Actions **taken**
- Observations/perceptions
- Previous relevant memories
- Goal states

> *Challenge: Designing embeddings that maintain essential detail while compressing diverse and high-dimensional state data is non-trivial.*

### 2. Transformation Pipeline

```
Raw State → Pre-processing → Embedding → Dimensionality Reduction → Compressed Vector
```

- **Pre-processing**: Normalizes and structures heterogeneous state data  
- **Embedding**: Maps processed state to high-dimensional semantic vectors (using models like sentence-transformers)  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Optional compression step (PCA, UMAP) to reduce vector size while preserving relationships  
- **Feature Weighting**: Emphasizes important aspects of state (e.g., position, goals) based on context

> *Challenge: Embedding dimensionality and feature weighting must be tuned to balance semantic expressiveness with efficient storage.*

### 3. Autoencoder Network

```
Full State → Encoder → Latent Representation → Decoder → Reconstructed State
```

- **Encoder**: Trained to compress full state into compact latent vectors  
- **Latent Space**: The compressed representation that captures essential state information  
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs approximate full state from compressed representation

> *Challenge: Training high-fidelity autoencoders requires diverse experiences and significant computational resources.*

### 4. Memory Store

- Stores compressed state vectors with timestamps and metadata  
- Supports efficient similarity queries (approximate nearest neighbor search)  
- Implements importance-based retention policies  

> *Challenge: Memory consolidation strategies must avoid catastrophic forgetting of rare but important experiences.*

---

## Operational Flow

### Memory Formation
1. Agent experiences a state S at time t  
2. The transformation pipeline processes S into a compressed vector V  
3. V is stored in the memory database with timestamp and metadata  
4. Periodically, less important memories are consolidated or pruned

> *Challenge: Determining importance and preserving semantic diversity during pruning is critical to avoiding memory bias.*

### Memory Retrieval
1. Agent forms a query state Q (current situation or hypothetical)  
2. Q is processed through the transformation pipeline into query vector Vq  
3. Vector database returns K most similar memory vectors to Vq  
4. Optional: Decoder reconstructs full states from returned memory vectors

> *Challenge: Evaluation of retrieval quality must balance similarity, contextual relevance, and diversity.*

### Memory Utilization
1. Retrieved memories inform agent decision-making  
2. Memories can be "replayed" by reconstructing states and simulating outcomes  
3. Memory patterns can be analyzed to identify agent behavioral patterns  
4. Novel situations (those with no close memories) are flagged for special attention

## Implementation Details

### Embedding Approaches
- **Text-based**: Convert state to textual description, then use language models (BERT, MPNet)  
- **Multimodal**: Combine specialized embeddings for different state components  
- **Custom Networks**: Train domain-specific embedding networks

> *Challenge: Training embeddings that integrate multimodal information while maintaining interpretability and generalization.*

### Autoencoder Architecture
- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: Adds regularization for smoother latent space  
- **Hierarchical Models**: Capture information at multiple levels of abstraction  
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on most relevant aspects of state during encoding/decoding

> *Challenge: These architectures increase computational costs and require more data for stable training.*

### Training Strategy
1. **Self-supervised Learning**: Train on agent experience without explicit labels  
2. **Reconstruction Loss**: Minimize difference between original and reconstructed states  
3. **Contrastive Objectives**: Ensure similar states have similar vectors, dissimilar states have distant vectors  
4. **Regularization**: Prevent overfitting to maintain generalization capabilities

> *Challenge: Without effective regularization and contrastive supervision, semantic drift and overfitting can undermine memory quality.*

## Benefits and Applications

### Memory Efficiency
- Dramatic reduction in storage requirements compared to storing full states  
- Scalability to long-lived agents with extensive experience histories  

### Improved Retrieval
- Semantic similarity search returns genuinely relevant experiences  
- Context-aware memory prioritizes important experiences  
- Fast vector similarity operations enable real-time retrieval  

### Enhanced Cognition
- **Episodic Memory**: Recall of contextually rich experiences  
- **Associative Recall**: Finding related experiences across different scenarios  
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Modifying memories to explore alternatives  
  - *Vector Space Operations*: Performing algebraic transformations on latent vectors to simulate hypothetical future states (e.g., v_future = v_current + (v_action_effect - v_baseline))
  - *For a detailed explanation, see [Counterfactual Reasoning Capability](counterfactual_reasoning_capability.md)*
- **Experience Generalization**: Identifying patterns across multiple memories  

### Development Advantages
- **Interpretability**: Visualizing the embedding space reveals agent behavior patterns  
- **Diagnostics**: Identifying gaps in experience or behavioral loops  
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging memories across similar environments

## Evaluation Framework

To support TASM development and validation, we propose a multi-metric evaluation framework:

- **Semantic Retrieval Accuracy**: Precision/recall of memory retrieval in similar contexts  
- **Reconstruction Error**: L2 or perceptual loss between original and reconstructed states  
- **Compression Ratio**: Size of latent vector vs. full state representation  
- **Diversity Index**: Measure of how well memory captures a range of agent experiences  
- **Recall of Rare Events**: Retention rate of semantically unique but infrequent states

## Conclusion

The Tiered Adaptive Semantic Memory (TASM) system represents a potential shift from traditional agent memory systems. By focusing on the meaning and relationships between experiences rather than their raw representations, it creates more human-like memory capabilities that support sophisticated reasoning, learning, and adaptation.

> TASM's effectiveness will depend on navigating challenges in training, compression fidelity, memory retention, and evaluation—but its potential for scalable, semantically rich memory makes it a powerful direction for next-gen intelligent agents.
